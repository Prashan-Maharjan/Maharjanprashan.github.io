Github is used for the pair project assigned in evidence based business analytics course. Here, the first step is to register your account in github. after signing up, you should create a repository of your own and change it into main. This way all the edits and changes are done in the 'readme' file. 'Actions' help to know all the changes made in the github. You can edit and code in 'Readme.md' file which is primarily written in markdown format. The syntax is the same as of markdown option we previously used in python.
